    required: false
    default: 2000
    minimum: 1000
    unit: ms
    description: |
      Interval in milliseconds between sensor readings.
      Default is 2 seconds.


  power-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: false
    description: |
      GPIO pin used to power the DHT11 sensor.
      If not specified, the sensor is assumed to be always powered.
