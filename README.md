# DHT11 Custom Driver Module for Zephyr RTOS

A custom DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor driver implemented as a Zephyr module for learning purposes.

## Overview 

This project demonstrates how to create a custom sensor driver as an external Zephyr module. The DHT11 is a digital temperature and humidity sensor that uses a single-wire bidirectional protocol.

## Features

- Full Zephyr sensor API implementation.
- Devicetree integration
- Kconfig configuration
- Structured as reusable Zephyr module
- Logging support
